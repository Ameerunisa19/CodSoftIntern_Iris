It's a machine learning application for accurate flower identification and classification. The dataset includes 150 records of three Iris species: Setosa, Virginica, and Versicolor, each with 50 samples. Four measurements (sepal and petal length and width) are recorded in centimeters.
Our project aims to build a model for precise species classification using these attributes.
